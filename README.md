<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
### 🌟 About The Project

Nowadays, learning a new language naturally can be hard.

Here's why:
* Learning platforms like Duolingo teach grammar and translation, but not necessarily using the language in coversation.
* You often have to travel or seek out rare opportunities to find native speakers of the language you are learning.
* If you speak another language in an english accent in a public setting, native speakers will likely default to english rather than continuing the conversation in their language.

My inspiration for this project came from a video I saw online. A user shared that she was trying to learn French by speaking French to service workers in Paris, but they would always reply in English anyways since her accent was so poor. She felt as if it was impossible to practice since no one gave her the chance.

So, I made Fluent.
